[GroundTruth]
This folder consists of the manually created ground truth of the trails. A ReadMe.txt file is included in the folder for data format description.

[Polygons]
This folder includes the polygons of 30 m by 30 m squared plots in ESRI shapefiles used to clip the point clouds.

[SourceCodes]
This folder consists of the C/C++ codes of the implemented workflow. Refer to the ReadMe.txt file in the folder for a detailed description of the modules.
